// Turning a video page URL into a player URL we're willing to put in an iframe.
//
// ⚠ The embed URL is derived HERE, from a table we maintain — never taken from
// the provider. oEmbed replies carry an `html` field containing a ready-made
// iframe, and dropping a third party's markup into the message list would be an
// XSS vector with a standards document attached. We read the structured fields
// (title, author, thumbnail) and construct the player ourselves, so the only
// origins that can ever end up in a frame are the ones written below.
//
// Everything here is privacy-first by construction:
//
//   - YouTube goes to youtube-nocookie.com, which defers tracking cookies until
//     playback actually starts.
//   - The thumbnail is proxied through us like any other preview image, so not
//     even the *thumbnail* request reaches Google. This matters more than it
//     sounds: a channel with fifty YouTube links in scrollback would otherwise
//     hand Google fifty impressions of you, from your IP, for videos you never
//     watched.
//   - The iframe is not created until the viewer clicks play (the facade
//     pattern, in the clients). Nothing here talks to a provider on render.
//
// So the full sequence for a YouTube link is: our server scrapes the page, our
// server fetches the thumbnail, our server hands the client a card — and the
// first request the *viewer* makes to Google is the one they asked for by
// pressing ▶.
