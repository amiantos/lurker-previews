// The one definition of "an address the cell must not dial".
//
// Two features hand the cell an address that someone else chose, and both are
// SSRF in the classic shape — the cell connects, and the result comes back to a
// user:
//
//   - DCC SEND offers (services/dcc.ts): the host comes from a CTCP message any
//     IRC user can send, and the response is written to a downloadable file.
//   - Link previews (services/linkFetch.ts): the host comes from a URL any IRC
//     user can paste, and the response is parsed into a card or proxied to a
//     browser.
//
// Same threat, same answer, so it lives once. On a hosted cell the VPC
// neighbours — the control plane, other cells — sit squarely in the blocked
// ranges, which is what makes this load-bearing rather than hygienic.
//
// ⚠⚠ IPv6 is an ALLOWLIST, not a denylist, and that asymmetry is deliberate.
// An earlier version enumerated the bad IPv6 prefixes and returned `false`
// (allow) for anything it didn't recognise. That shipped a real hole: the WHATWG
// URL parser rewrites an IPv4-mapped literal into hex, so
// `http://[::ffff:169.254.169.254]/` arrives as `[::ffff:a9fe:a9fe]` — which
// matched none of the deny prefixes and was allowed straight through to the
// cloud metadata endpoint. `net.isIP()` calls that string IPv6, so node skips
// DNS for it and `pinnedLookup` never runs either; this function was the only
// guard on the path, and it said yes.
//
// The lesson is the general one: a denylist over a 128-bit space with several
// IPv4-embedding notations cannot be audited. Only 2000::/3 is global unicast,
// so that's what we allow, and everything we can't parse or don't recognise is
// refused.
